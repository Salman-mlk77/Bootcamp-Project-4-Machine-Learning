## Introduction
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis and machine learning on a dataset about Math course using Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,plotly ,and Scikit-learn.
and find the appropriate regression model 

## Dataset Overview and Source.
Our data from this resource https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance


## results of ML models
| Regression model  | MAE | MSE | RMSE | R2 score |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Linear Regression Model| 1.26 | 4.68 | 2.16 | 0.79 |
|Lasso Regression Model| 1.26|4.90| 2.21| 0.78|
|Decision Tree Regression Model | 1.22|3.43|1.85|  0.84 |


## conclusion and recommendations 
From the table above, it is clear that for the present problem, the best performing model is Decision Tree Regression model with the highest R square (Coefficient of Determination) and least RMAE.
